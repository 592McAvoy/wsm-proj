# TODO
1. (about 30% scores) Support tolerant(fuzzy) search. Users may wrongly type some
information or process wild-card queries and the system is required to do fuzzy
search.
2. (about 30% scores) Support several ranking methods. You need to implement at
least five kinds of ranking algorithms. Note that you are not allowed to use the
existing frameworks such as Lucene.
3. (about 20% scores) Speed. Given a query, you need to quickly return the ranked
list. You should show the effectiveness and search time of each ranking algorithm
you implement.
4. (about 20% scores) Provide friendly search system GUI
